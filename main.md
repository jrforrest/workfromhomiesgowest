## Living

This vehicle-based adventure will be putting us in some of the grandest
parks in the North American continent with camping close enough to towns
that the trip can be done without a single night spent under a proper roof.

## Working

Each stop has been based around the availability of a fully provisioned co-working
space with the amenities you need to focus on your job when it's time to work.

Daily drop in fees are usually fairly pricey for a good coworking space,
but with group rate negotiation and week-long commitments its looking
like we'll be able to get down to get in the neighborhood of $100 per
week per desk.

## Playing

With trails, lakes and climbing routes available at just about every stop there
won't be any lack of ways to go get after it when the day's work is done.
